# Redesign-Strumentimusicali.net
Redesign Strumentimusicali.net website

Hi there, this is a redesign of the homepage of a famous Italian ecommerce that sells musical instruments. I keep using the original colours but I completely redesign the homepage. I didn't use any Javascript, as the original one. I tried to maintain a good level of fidelity with the old one but I tried to moodernize it.
- In SRC folder, you can find all the images that I used for the project.
- In the Style folder, you can find the CSS file of the project.
